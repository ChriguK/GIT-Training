How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I found the differences much faster!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could jump bach and forth in history much faster.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You commit whenever you think it is important.
    Pros: You can define your commit messages.
    Cons: You forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    GIT was made for programmers. Programs (and other stuff like web pages)
    are organized in different files. So it makes sense to allow saving multiple files at once.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the version history.
    git diff shows differences among files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can alway go back to a previous state.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
    
    I would like to organize the RSS feeds with it.
