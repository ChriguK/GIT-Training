When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I collaborate with other people.
  When I use different computers for development.
  I could also use the remote repository as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I want to work on my version of the code. I do not want that my code is automatically merged with code from other people.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are clones on Github.
	Clones are copies of repositories from Github or a local repository into a new repository.
	Branches are different developmental strains in a repository.
	
	When developing new features, fixing bugs, refactoring code, etc. I usually use branches.
	When I collaborate with others I would use a clone.
	If I want to change another person's code without affecting the other person's Git repository, I would fork that persons repository.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	The local and remote repositories can be merged easily (even offline - if necessary). If you made mistakes when merging those mistakes
	can be corrected without being pushed to the remote repository.
